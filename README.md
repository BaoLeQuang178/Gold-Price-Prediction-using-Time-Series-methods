# Gold Price Prediction using Time Series methods
Gold has been a valuable asset and a safe-haven investment for centuries, making it an essential commodity for traders and investors. In this context, the project "Gold price prediction using time series method" aims to develop a predictive model using time series analysis techniques to forecast the price of gold. The project involves analyzing historical gold price data and applying time series models such as Naive Forecast with trend-adjusted, Holt's Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Random Forest to make predictions for future prices. The results of this project can be useful for investors, financial analysts, and researchers to make informed decisions based on accurate predictions of gold prices.

Results show that Holt's Exponential Smooth, ARIMA and Random Forecast are among the best methods to forecast Gold price using various financial indicators. The conclusion is based on three metrics including MAE, RMSE and MAPE.
