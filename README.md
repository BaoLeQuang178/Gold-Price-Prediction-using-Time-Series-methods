# Gold Price Prediction using Time Series methods
Gold has been a valuable asset and a safe-haven investment for centuries, making it an essential commodity for traders and investors. With the recent volatility and uncertainty in the global economy, the demand for gold has surged, making it a popular choice for investors. Accurate prediction of gold prices can help traders and investors make informed decisions, leading to better returns on their investments. In this context, the project "Gold price prediction using time series method" aims to develop a predictive model using time series analysis techniques to forecast the price of gold. The project involves analyzing historical gold price data and applying time series models such as Naive Forecast with trend-adjusted, Holt's Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Random Forest to make predictions for future prices. The results of this project can be useful for investors, financial analysts, and researchers to make informed decisions based on accurate predictions of gold prices.
